ALX TASKS FOR C-DEBUGGING

TASK 0: Multiple mains
Based on the main.c file given, I created a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function "positive_or_negative()" gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
Note: You are not coding the solution/function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from "0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0" to compile with this main file to test locally. You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. The "positive_or_negative()" function is provided. You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

TASK 1: Like, comment, subscribe
Copy a given main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!), the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Note: Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code. You do not have to compile with "-Wall" "-Werror" "-Wextra" "-pedantic" for this task.

TASK 2: 0 > 972?
A given program prints the largest of three integers. But something is definitely not right.
Fix the code in the program (2-largest_number.c) so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
Note: Line count will not be checked for this task.

TASK 3: Leap year
The given program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. However, something doesn't seem right.
Fix the "print_remaining_days()" function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
Note: Line count will not be checked for this task. You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31). You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
