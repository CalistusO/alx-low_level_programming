ALX TASKS FOR C-MORE FUNCTIONS, MORE NESTED LOOPS

TASK 0: A function that checks for uppercase character.
Note: Returns 1 if c is uppercase. Returns 0 otherwise.

TASK 1: A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
Note: Returns 1 if c is a digit. Returns 0 otherwise.

TASK 2: A function that multiplies two integers.

TASK 3: A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use (putchar) twice in your code.

TASK 4: A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Note: Do not print 2 and 4. You can only use (putchar) twice in your code.

TASK 5: A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use (putchar) three times in your code.

TASK 6: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
Note: You can only use (putchar) function to print. Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed. The line should end with a \n. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n.

TASK 7: A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
Note: You can only use (putchar) function to print. Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed. The diagonal should end with a \n. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n.

TASK 8: A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use (putchar) function to print. Where size is the size of the square. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line. Use the character # to print the square.

TASK 9: The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. 
This is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

TASK 10: A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use (putchar) function to print. Where size is the size of the triangle. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line. Use the character # to print the triangle.

TASK 11: The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.This is a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
Note: You are allowed to use the standard library.

TASK 12: A function that prints an integer.
Note: You can only use (putchar) function to print. You are not allowed to use "long". You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers. You are not allowed to hard-code special values.
