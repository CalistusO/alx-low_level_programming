ii. You can only use putchar function to print  
iii. Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed  
iv. The line should end with a \n  
v. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

i. Prototype: void print_square(int size);  
ii. You can only use putchar function to print  
iii. Where size is the size of the square  
iv. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line  
v. Use the character # to print the square  

**Task 9: 9-fizzbuzz.c**  
The Fizz-Buzz test is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.  
i. Each number or word should be separated by a space  
ii. You are allowed to use the standard library  

**Task 10: 10-printtriangle.c**
