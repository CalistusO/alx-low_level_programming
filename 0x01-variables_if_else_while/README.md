ii. The output of the program should be:  
The number, followed by  
a. if the number is greater than 0: is positive  
b. if the number is 0: is zero  
c. if the number is less than 0: is negative  
iii. followed by a new line  


Task 1: 1-last_digit.c  
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.  
i. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program  
ii. The output of the program should be:  
The string "Last digit of", followed by  
n, followed by  
The string "is", followed by  
a. if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"  
b. if the last digit of n is 0: the string "and is 0"
