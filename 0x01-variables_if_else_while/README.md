ALX TASKS ON C - Variables, if, else, while

Task 0: This program assigns a random number to the variable "n" each time it is executed.

Task 1: This program assigns a random number to the variable "n" each time it is executed.

Task 2: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function (printf, puts, etc… is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" twice in your code.

Task 3: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function (printf, puts, etc… is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" three times in your code.

Task 4: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Note: Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function (printf, puts, etc… is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" twice in your code.

Task 5: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

Task 6: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. 
Note: You are not allowed to use any variable of type "char". You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). You can only use "putchar" twice in your code. All your code should be in the main function.

Task 7: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
Note: You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" twice in your code.

Task 8: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. 
Note: You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function; printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" three times in your code.

Task 9: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
Note: Numbers must be separated by a comma (,), followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function; printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use "putchar" four times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type "char".

Task 10: A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
Note: Numbers must be separated by a comma (,) followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function; printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). You can only use "putchar" five times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type "char". All your code should be in the main function.

Task 11: A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
Note: Numbers must be separated by a comma (,), followed by a space. The three digits must be different. 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2. Print only the smallest combination of three digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits. You can only use the "putchar" function (every other function; printf, puts, etc. is forbidden). You can only use "putchar" six times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type "char". All your code should be in the main function.

Task 12:
